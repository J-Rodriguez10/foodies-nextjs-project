## Foodies Project:
This project is part of Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's [NextJs Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) on Udemy! It showcases a website where users can browse and share meals within the NextLevel Food Community.

The website leverages core Next.js features such as dynamic routing, server/client components, and server actions. In addition to the original project, I have incorporated TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to enhance functionality and styling.

## Built With:
- Typescript/Javascript
- NextJs
- Sqlite3
- Tailwind
